If you hear its grinding approach, silence your movement and escape the area immediately, as its attention is a death sentence.",

It rarely operates alone, preferring to patrol the skies alongside a swarm of Wasps or to act as an aerial shield for a larger, ground-based ARC. Its main attack is a focused, high-speed projectile. Watch for the brief, one-second pulse of a red aiming laser—that's your warning before it fires a specialized stun round designed to shred Raider shields and tear through light armor almost instantly.",

Its heavy armor gives it a hulking, near-indestructible presence on the battlefield, but don't mistake its bulk for sluggishness. This mechanized spider possesses an unnerving, gravity-defying ability to leap vast distances. Reports confirm it has been seen clearing impossible gaps, even bounding effortlessly to the summit of a Spaceport tower. It's a vertical threat you can't simply hide from.",

It operates by rapidly closing the distance, looking like nothing more than a simple, harmless sphere until it's right on top of you. Once a Raider is nearby, it snaps open its side panels to reveal twin flamethrowers, quickly bathing the area in fire and burning targets to a crisp. It's a close-range ambush specialist designed to punish anyone caught off-guard.",

    "description": "This is the Goliath of the ARC forces, a colossal machine whose presence defines the battlefield. It is only deployed during the critical Harvester Event, acting as the immovable guardian of the Harvester unit. Its incredible durability and lethal arsenal make it the single greatest threat on the map; attempting to scratch its armor alone is a fool's errand—you'll need a full squad of Raiders working in concert just to stand a chance.\n\nIts attacks are devastating:\n\nMortar Barrage: The dome atop the unit launches three massive mortars that land in a cluster around a targeted Raider. Two seconds after impact, they detonate in a fiery, engulfing inferno.\n\nSustained Laser: It periodically sweeps its primary weapon, firing a continuous laser beam at any Raider it acquires in its line-of-sight.\n\nClose-Quarters Deterrents: Should Raiders try to get up close and personal, the Goliath switches modes, delivering either a disruptive EMP pulse to shut down technology or a crushing ground slam to obliterate anything nearby.",

It poses a significant threat not just because it flies, but because of its powerful rocket attacks and devastating focus on area-of-effect (AoE) damage. This unit is designed to saturate an area, turning cover into a liability and forcing Raiders to constantly relocate or be wiped out by the sheer force of its explosions. Treat it like a mobile artillery piece—it hits hard and wide.",

    "description": "This little flyer is a swift and unarmored scout drone, often identifiable by its cluster of three rotors. While individually fragile, its primary danger is its role as an aerial alarm system. Once it spots Raiders, it immediately triggers a wide-band signal, effectively calling in a wave of flying ARC reinforcements—usually a swarm of Wasps or Hornets—to descend on your position. Taking it out before it completes its transmission is essential, as its light frame means a single, well-aimed burst will shatter it.",

    "description": "This is the largest of the rolling ARCs, a massive, spherical construct designed to dominate open ground. Its primary tactic is to stop periodically on the battlefield to transmit disruptive signals, acting as a massive relay for the ARC network. Be warned, however, its most unique (and dangerous) trait is its resilience: as it takes damage, its outer shell breaks apart into many smaller, armored pieces. Its final attack is a relentless one: it will roll directly at high speed toward any Raider it detects, essentially turning itself into a giant, high-impact bowling ball.",

    "threat": "Low",
    "description": "This terrifying enemy, often called the Tick, is a small, unarmored ARC that specializes in the perfect ambush. It uses dark, indoor spaces—particularly the undersides of ceilings and dark corners of walls—as its hunting ground. It waits in absolute stillness until a Raider passes underneath. Then, without warning, it lunges for your head, aiming to latch directly onto your face or helmet. Once attached, it relentlessly drains your health and shield meter simultaneously. The panic is compounded by the fact that you must hold the [Interact] button to forcibly pry the parasite off, an agonizing process that leaves you exposed to other threats.",

    "description": "This is a small, unarmored turret that provides close-quarters defense for the ARC. Its primary function is to scan constantly for movement, and you’ll typically find it mounted on interior walls inside buildings. Do not confuse this swift little gun with the massive, high-altitude Sentinel turrets you find outside. When it spots a Raider, it immediately opens fire, unleashing a two-second hail of bullets in an attempt to suppress and eliminate the threat quickly. Its lack of armor makes it fragile, but its location makes it dangerous.",

    "description": "This is the Wasp, a baseline enemy drone that poses a threat through sheer numbers. It is a small, unarmored flyer that peppers Raiders with light-caliber ammunition. You'll almost never encounter a Wasp alone; they operate in tight patrols alongside other Wasps or as escorts for their more dangerous counterpart, the Hornet. The moment it turns aggressive, look for a small red laser to lock onto you for one second—that's your cue to dodge before it unleashes a quick 1.5-second burst of gunfire.",
